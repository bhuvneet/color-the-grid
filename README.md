# color-the-grid https://bhuvneet.github.io/color-the-grid/
- This project, I used native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a default 16x16 grid of squares.
- The user can change the grid size by adding a new value in input box to change the number of grids. 
- When the mouse is hovered over the grid, it changes color as the mouse moves.
- The project uses JS event listeners to enable this functionality and generates a random color using the Math library when the mouse is hovered over the cell.

A fun-interactive project to color the grids like so.
